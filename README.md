## Hi there! I'm Bradley, also known as bradleythedeveloper.
- I'm a Computer Science A-level student from England.
- I'm currently practising my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, to use with Svelte.
- I'm using Svelte to build my first serious project, a productivity app called hypetasks.
- I am fairly confident with Python (from what I have learnt at school).
